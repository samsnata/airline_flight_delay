Airline Flight Delay Analysis
Flight delays are a significant challenge for both the airline and passengers, causing disruptions, financial losses, and dissatisfaction. As part of the airlineâ€™s data analytics team, my goal is to analyze historical flight data to uncover delay patterns, identify operational inefficiencies, and predict delays before they occur. By identifying delay patterns, predicting delays, and uncovering the factors that contribute most to delays, I am able to drive operational efficiency and enhance the overall passenger experience. My insights helped the airline make data-driven decisions to optimize scheduling, improve on-time performance, and enhance passenger satisfaction.
I created a report summarizing my insights exploring the following questions:

How do different airlines compare in terms of their departure and arrival times? Are there noticeable trends in their on-time performance over the year? A well-structured visualization could help uncover patterns.
Are there particular months/weeks/time of day where there is a general trend of greater delays in flights across all carriers? If so, what could be the reasons?
Some airports seem to operate like clockwork, while others are notorious for disruptions. How do different airports compare when it comes to departure and arrival punctuality? Could location, traffic volume, or other factors play a role? Are there patterns that emerge when looking at delays across various airports?
[Optional 1] Predict whether a flight will have a delay of 15 minutes or more at departure.
[Optional 2] What underlying factors influence flight delays the most? Are some routes more prone to disruptions than others? Do external variables like time of day, distance, or carrier policies play a significant role? By analyzing the relationships between different features, you might discover unexpected insights.
